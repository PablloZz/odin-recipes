        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch cake
            pans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make cake: Place white sugar and butter into a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer
            on
            medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each
            addition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture in batches,
            alternating with milk, beating batter briefly after each addition. Add vanilla extract;
            beat
            until batter makes ribbons when falling from the beaters. Divide batter among the
            prepared
            cake pans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean,
            about
            30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to
            loosen.
            Invert carefully onto a cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make icing: Combine brown sugar, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir
            until
            brown sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Add evaporated milk and continue stirring.
            Bring
            to a gentle boil and let bubble for about 4 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid
            sticking.
            Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract into brown sugar mixture using an electric
            mixer until icing caramelizes and thickens to the desired consistency.
          </li>
          <li>Spread icing onto cooled cake layers. Stack layers; ice top and sides.</li>
